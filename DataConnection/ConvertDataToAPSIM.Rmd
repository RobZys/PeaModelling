## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Read data - requires ReadbiomassData to be run first


```{r }
#Read consist data for report and analysis

 
 SourceRootDir<- "C:\\GithubRepos\\PeaModelling\\DataConnection\\"
 DestRootDir<- "C:\\GithubRepos\\PeaModelling\\DataConnection\\"
 dataset_name <- "Pea_Biomass_N_LAI" # needed to name the outputfiles consistently (labels, consistent and apsim .txt)

# 
 cd_Path <- paste0(DestRootDir, "ObservedData_",dataset_name,".txt")
# 
df_obsData <- data_frame()
df_obsData <- read.table(cd_Path , header = TRUE,  sep = '\t')
# #print(cd_Path)


```

## Sumerise Reps


```{r  echo=FALSE}

df_DataSum<- df_obsData %>% 
  group_by(Site,Date,Trt_name) %>%  

 summarise_if(is.numeric,funs(mean))
  
   
summary(df_DataSum)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Lets get a list of the Columns I want

```{r}
VariableList <- c("Site","Date","Trt_name","Trt_num","LeafArea","Stem_area","Pod_area","AboveGroundWt","leafLiveWt","StemLiveWt","DeadWt","PodLiveWt","GrainWt","GrainLiveWt","LeafNConc","leafN","StemNConc","StemN","GrainNConc")

df_ReqData <- df_DataSum[,VariableList]

df_ReqData [is.numeric(df_ReqData) & is.na(df_ReqData)] <- "*"

```

### now save in a form for apsim

```{r}
write.table(df_ReqData,  cd_Path <- paste0(DestRootDir, "PeaSumData.txt"), row.names = F, quote = F, sep = '\t')
```
