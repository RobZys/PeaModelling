## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Read consist data for report and analysis

 
 SourceRootDir<- "C:\\GithubRepos\\PeaModelling\\DataConnection\\"
 DestRootDir<- "C:\\GithubRepos\\PeaModelling\\DataConnection\\"
 dataset_name <- "Pea_Biomass_N_LAI" # needed to name the outputfiles consistently (labels, consistent and apsim .txt)

# 
 cd_Path <- paste0(DestRootDir, "ObservedData_",dataset_name,".txt")
# 
df_obsData <- data_frame()
df_obsData <- read.table(cd_Path , header = TRUE,  sep = '\t')
# #print(cd_Path)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
